# Unit Test Coverage Report Meaning

##### Test Coverage

*Test Coverage = (Executed Test cases/Total Test cases) * 100*

##### Code Coverage

*Code Coverage = (number of lines of code executed/ total number of lines of code)* * 100

##### Methodologies

- **Statement Coverage** represent instructions that have been executed at least once during the unit tests.
  
  - to ensure that each line of the source code is covered at least once by the tests. *i think this is line coverage.* *ooh no, it's **statement** eg: var age=18*
    

- **Function Coverage** represent functions that have been called at least once during the unit tests.
  
  - a function had been called once, then consider the as a complete function coverage
    
- **Condition Coverage**
  
  - make sure true of false are both covered, then the coverage would be 100%.
    
- **Branch Coverage** represent if statements which conditions have been fulfilled at least once during the unit tests.
  
  - this methodology aims at ensuring that every branch appearing in each conditional structure gets executed in source code.
    
- **Lines Coverage** represent code lines that have executed at least once during the unit tests.
