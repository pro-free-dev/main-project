# what is `Hard Link` and `Soft Link`?
A hard link is a directory entry, that associates a name with a file.
A symbolic link (also called symlink or soft link) is a `term` for any file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path and that affects pathname resolution.
